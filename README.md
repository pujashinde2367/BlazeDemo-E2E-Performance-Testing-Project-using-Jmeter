# BlazeDemo-E2E-Performance-Testing-Project-using-Jmeter

Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end performance testing framework built using Apache JMeter for the BlazeDemo flight booking website.

The goal of this project is to simulate real-user behavior for booking flights and to measure:

Response times

Throughput

Error rates

End-to-end transaction performance

Website under test: https://blazedemo.com

🎯 Objectives

Validate performance of critical user journey (flight booking)

Measure total transaction time using Transaction Controller

Perform load testing with multiple concurrent users

Apply assertions to validate functional correctness

Use parameterization and correlation for realistic testing

🧱 Test Plan Structure
1️⃣ Test Plan

BlazeDemo_E2E_Performance_Test

Central container for all test elements

2️⃣ User Defined Variables
Variable	Description
BASE_URL	Application base URL
PROTOCOL	HTTP protocol (https)
THINK_TIME	User think time between actions
3️⃣ Thread Group: E2E_User_Load
Setting	Value
Threads (Users)	50
Ramp-Up Period	10 seconds
Loop Count	5

Simulates concurrent users performing booking operations.

4️⃣ Config Elements
HTTP Request Defaults

Protocol: https

Server Name: blazedemo.com

HTTP Header Manager

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0

HTTP Cookie Manager

Maintains session consistency

CSV Data Set Config

File: cities.csv

Variables: from, to

Used for source and destination city parameterization

5️⃣ Logic Controller
Transaction Controller: Flight_Booking_Transaction

Measures total response time of the complete booking flow

Includes timers and post-processors

6️⃣ HTTP Samplers
🏠 Home_Page

Method: GET

Path: /

Assertion: Verifies homepage load

🔍 Search_Flights

Method: POST

Path: /reserve.php

Parameters: fromPort, toPort

Extracts dynamic flight value using Regex Extractor

✈️ Choose_Flight

Method: POST

Path: /purchase.php

Uses correlated flight parameter

💳 Purchase_Ticket

Method: POST

Path: /confirmation.php

Submits passenger and payment details

7️⃣ Assertions

Response Assertions for functional validation

Duration Assertion (Global): Max response time 3000 ms

8️⃣ Timers

Constant Timer: Think time between requests

Gaussian Random Timer (optional) for realistic load

9️⃣ Listeners
Listener	Purpose
View Results Tree	Debugging only
Summary Report	High-level metrics
Aggregate Report	Performance analysis
Graph Results	Visualization
🔟 tearDown Thread Group (Optional)

Used for cleanup or logout steps after execution

📊 Key Metrics Captured

Average response time

90th & 95th percentile

Error percentage

Throughput

End-to-end transaction time
